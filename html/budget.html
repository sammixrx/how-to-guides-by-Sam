<h1> Managing a budget</h1>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p> There are many simple ways to manage your budget, the 1st thing you should do is <b>Calculate your bills!</b></p><br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>When I do this I go over what I am due to get paid from work using an average of hours worked multiplied per week and taking off VAT & any other outgoings that go straight from your paycheck<br>
</br> This will give me a basic sum of what I will get in a month. From this you want to take off all your own personal outgoings such as;<br>
</br> Rent (or morgage), Taxes, Transport, Insurance (if any), Utility bills (including water, gas, electric and internet/tv), Contract payments (such as mobile phone) and any outstanding debt (such as credit cards etc)<br>
</br> the sum you will get will probably seem quite daunting at first, you see your paycheck pretty much all disappear on day one! You've now got to do the grocery shopping as well!<br>
</br> Luckily, these basic guides I have put together will help a little with this!<br>
    Within this page you will find essential shopping lists which is a basis for your first shop and what essentials you may need in your kitchen<br>
<br>
<br>
</br> Not only that but there is also some basic guides on how to use a washing machine, how to check the oil on a car, a basic furniture guide and how to find better deals on your bills</p>
