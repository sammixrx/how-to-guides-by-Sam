<h1>Essentials Lists & Shopping guides</h1>

<h2>Essential Kitchen Items</h2>
<p>When it comes to buys for your first kitchen it is important to get all the basics before you start buying the fancy stuff!<br>
</br> For me at least the very basics are as follows;<br>
<br>
<list> 2x Chopping boards - one for meat and one for vegetable
    A selection of different cutting knives (You can get a basic knife block from places like Wilko or large Tesco stores)
    Cutlery (I would get enough for 4 people just incase you have guests)
    Plates & bowls (again, I would get 4 incase of guests)
    Washing up sponges
    A set of different sized pans (with lids)
    A large wok or frying pan
    Large wooden or silicone spoons 
    Masher
    Tin opener
    Spatula
    Colinder
    Whisk
    Measuring spoons
    Oven trays
    Mugs & glasses
    Rolling pin
    Drying rack for plates
    Washing up tub
</list></br>

<h3> Essential Electrics for your kitchen</h3>
<p> We all move out eventually and we are usually going to be given most of the things listed above, or perhaps you already bought some in preparation for moving <br>
</br> Here is my list of what I would class as basic electrics for your kitchen, I am not going to include large items<br>
<list>Toaster
    Microwave
    Slow cooker/crock prot
    Air fryer
    Rice cooker
    Kettle
</list></br>

</p>

<h4>Meal Prep</h4>
<p>
    When you are on a budget it is important to meal prep, to do this you will need Ziploc bags and some plastic containers! Its as simple as that!<br>
</br>If you usually find yourself making too much food or decide to bulk cook meals rather than letting it go to waste, you can just put it away for another day<br>
</br>you can freeze and reheat most things, with a few exceptions that you can find by a simple internet search (one example is eggs)<br>
</br>Another things you can do to save money and save food waste is start to buy frozen vegetables, tinned fruit and easy garlic, ginger and chillies
</p>

<h5>Shopping lists</h5>
<p>
    So it is finally time to do some grocery shopping, your first shop may cost a bit more than the average shop if you are starting from scratch, this is normal!<br>
</br>For your first shop you want to get a lot of spices, such as salt, pepper, chilli powder, curry powder and mixed herbs, you can usually find the 'own brand' versions which are a lot cheaper than the branded ones and are the exact same ingrediants!<br>
<br>
</br><b>First shop;</b><list>
    Pasta
    Rice
    Chopped tomatoes x4
    Spices (as listed above)
    Bread 
    Milk
    Chicken breasts or chicken thighs
    Mince beef
    Oil of choice 
    Butter
    Frozen vegetables (such as onions, peppers, mixed veg)
    Easy cut garlic and chillies (if you like your food spicy like I do!)
    Sauces of choice (ketchup, mayo etc)
    Potatoes of choice
    Washing up liquid
    Tea or coffee
    Flour, sugar, baking powder, yeast
    Laundry detergent and fabric softner *and dryer sheets if you also have a dryer*
    A very cheap bottle of red wine (this may seem like an expense, but I tend to add this to pasta sauces or even gravy for a fuller rich flavour)
    Gravy granules
</list>
