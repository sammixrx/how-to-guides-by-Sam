<h2> Hello and welcome to my how to guides! </h2><br>
<p>
</br> I have made this website for people who don't have a clue how to budget<br>
</br> or for people who just need that extra bit of help with budgeting.<br>
<br>
<br>
</br> As somebody who has lived alone for the past 12 years, I could have done with some of this help myself to begin with!<br>
</br> My first "big shop" cost me Â£90 because I wanted to get every single ingrediant possible for every single meal!<br>
</br> and the funny thing is, for that first shop everything I bought was completely useless for what I wanted!<br>
</br> 
<br> I hope that you can find some tips that I have learnt over the years!
</p> </br>
